# Microservice-Architecture

Microservices architecture is a software design approach that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable services. In this architecture, each service represents a specific functionality or business capability and operates as a separate, self-contained unit. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, often using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or messaging queues.

Microservices offer several benefits, including scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance. They allow teams to develop, test, and deploy individual services independently, enabling faster development cycles and the ability to use different technologies for different services. This architecture also enhances fault isolation, as a failure in one service doesn't necessarily affect the entire application. However, managing the complexities of inter-service communication, data consistency, and deployment orchestration can be challenges that need to be carefully addressed in a microservices-based system.


## Features

List of main features:
- **User Authentication:** The frontend microservice allows users to log in securely with their credentials. It collects user data and sends it to the authentication microservice for validation.
- **Video Content Display:** It showcases a variety of video posters on the main page, enticing users to explore the available content. Each video poster represents a video that users can watch by clicking on it.
- **Request Routing:** When users click on a video poster, the frontend microservice routes the request to the appropriate microservice responsible for video streaming, ensuring efficient and smooth video playback.
